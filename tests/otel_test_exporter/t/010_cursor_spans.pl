# Cross-statement cursor spans (DECLARE .. FETCH .. CLOSE).  otel_api
# P2 edge-case plan, postgres-cdq.10 / postgres-cdq.9.7 / postgres-cdq.9.16.
#
# A cursor's underlying "pgsql.execute" span is started by ExecutorStart
# at DECLARE time and only ended by ExecutorEnd at CLOSE time, but every
# statement in between (the DECLARE's own utility span, each FETCH's
# utility span, ...) pushes and pops its own span on otel_api's active
# stack.  Before postgres-cdq.10, that cursor span was not .detached,
# so it sat on the active stack across the statement boundary: as soon
# as the DECLARE statement's own wrapping span tried to end (it is
# BELOW the still-open cursor span on the stack, since the cursor
# executor span was pushed inside it and never popped), otel_api's
# "ended with spans still open above it" non-LIFO path fired --
# unwinding (exporting with ERROR status) the cursor's own span right
# after DECLARE, before any FETCH ever runs.  In a cassert build that
# path is not just a WARNING, it is Assert(false) in
# nonlifo_warning(): DECLARE CURSOR alone crashed the backend (see
# otel_producer.c's nonlifo_warning()).
#
# postgres-cdq.10 fixes this: the cursor's executor span is now
# .detached (otel_declaring_cursor_portal in otel_trace.c), and
# otel_ExecutorRun() calls otel_span_activate()/otel_span_deactivate()
# around just the one ExecutorRun call that belongs to each FETCH, so
# work done while materialising rows parents to the cursor span, and
# the span itself stays open from DECLARE to CLOSE.
#
# Spans/counters are backend-local (see t/001's header comment): each
# scenario below is one psql invocation/connection so capture and
# readback see the same backend.

# started while the transaction is in aborted-block state (i.e. for
# the ROLLBACK/ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT that recovers from *any* error
# inside an explicit BEGIN, not just a cursor's). That is out of scope

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Scenario 6 (postgres-cdq.10 review follow-up, defect 3): DECLARE
# CURSOR's query planning can run arbitrary nested statements before
# the cursor's own ExecutorStart ever runs -- e.g. constant-folding an
# IMMUTABLE function that itself executes SQL (PerformCursorOpen calls
# pg_plan_query(), which can invoke such a function via
# eval_const_expressions(), *before* it creates the portal and calls
# PortalStart() for the cursor itself). A flag that is merely "are we
# somewhere inside DECLARE CURSOR's ProcessUtility call" (the
# original otel_declaring_cursor_portal) is set across all of that
# too, wrongly marking every such nested statement's own span
# .detached -- not just the cursor's.
#
# Fixed by checking core's ActivePortal (tcop/pquery.h) against the
# cursor's own portal name: PortalStart() sets ActivePortal to the new
# cursor portal only immediately before calling ExecutorStart() for
# it, strictly after planning (and hence after any nested statements
# planning might run) has already finished.
#
# This was confirmed against the pre-fix code with a temporary
# diagnostic (not committed): logging otel_ExecutorStart()'s
# "is_cursor" decision showed it wrongly true for both nested
# statements below, and ActivePortal->name empty (the top-level
# unnamed portal) rather than "c" at that point -- proving the flag
# leaked. Fixed, it is only true for the cursor's own ExecutorStart.
#
# Note: once otel_declaring_cursor_name no longer leaks, both the
# nested statement and the cursor's query correctly compute their own
# parent from the active stack regardless -- otel_ExecutorRun()'s
# activate/deactivate (the postgres-cdq.10 fix itself) happens to
# mask the pre-fix mislabelling's effect on simple parentage checks
# for a *single* ExecutorRun per nested statement, since it still
# temporarily activates a wrongly-.detached span for the one
# ExecutorRun it belongs to. So this scenario is a regression/sanity
# check (no crash, correct results, correct nesting) rather than one
# that fails pre-fix; the fix's necessity is established by the
# diagnostic above and by code inspection (a wrongly-.detached span's
# bookkeeping entry is, for the wrong reason, treated as a cursor by
# otel_ExecutorRun()'s peek_cursor_span(), which does not generalise
# safely, e.g. to a nested statement run more than once).
