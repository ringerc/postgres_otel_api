 *
 * otel.c
 *	  OpenTelemetry trace-context support for PostgreSQL --- module
 *	  setup, coordination, and trace-context input layer.
 *
 * Loadable module that consumes the TraceContext ('M') protocol message
 * to receive a W3C Trace Context from the client and attach
 * the trace-id, span-id and trace-flags to every log message emitted
 * for the remainder of the current transaction.
 *
 * State storage:
 *
 * The active trace context is stored in two custom GUCs, mirroring the
 * two HTTP headers the W3C Trace Context spec defines:
 *
 *	 otel_api.traceparent  Required, fixed format:
 *					   "{version}-{trace-id}-{parent-id}-{flags}".
 *					   Every component has spec-defined semantics;
 *					   every conformant tracing participant MUST
 *					   understand it.  Our assign-hook parses and
 *					   decomposes the value into the in-memory
 *					   otel_root_ctx, read by span start and the emit_log_hook.
 *					   This is the load-bearing piece for log
 *					   correlation.
 *
 *	 otel_api.tracestate   Optional, vendor-extensible: a comma-separated
 *					   list of "vendor=value" pairs, where the
 *					   semantics of each value are defined by that
 *					   vendor's tracing system (Datadog, Honeycomb,
 *					   etc.), not by the W3C spec.
 *
 *					   We accept and store this opaquely.  We do NOT
 *					   interpret it, log it, or attach it to ErrorData
 *					   today.  It is kept for three reasons:
 *
 *					   1. The W3C spec requires that participants
 *						  propagate unknown tracestate entries
 *						  unchanged; clients that follow the spec
 *						  send both headers and would have to drop
 *						  vendor state at the Postgres boundary if we
 *						  refused tracestate.
 *					   2. Future use: if this module ever emits OTLP
 *						  child spans of its own, propagating
 *						  tracestate becomes mandatory.  Having the
 *						  storage in place now avoids a wire/API
 *						  change later.
 *					   3. Diagnostic visibility via SHOW
 *						  otel_api.tracestate when operators are
 *						  debugging trace propagation through proxy
 *						  chains.
 *
 *					   `tracestate` is NOT baggage.  W3C Baggage is a
 *					   separate spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/)
 *					   with its own HTTP header, key namespace, size
 *					   budget, and audience (application code, not
 *					   vendor tracing tools).  If an application
 *					   needs to propagate baggage --- e.g. tenant_id
 *					   for RLS, user_id for audit --- through
 *					   PostgreSQL, that belongs in a separate
 *					   `baggage.*` prefix handler (likely a sibling
 *					   `contrib/baggage` module), not in
 *					   `otel_api.tracestate`.
 *
 * Using GUCs as the canonical storage has a deliberate side effect:
 * GUC values automatically propagate to parallel workers via
 * RestoreGUCState during ParallelWorkerMain startup.  The workers'
 * assign-hooks then populate their own copies of the in-memory
 * otel_root_ctx, so worker-side log emission picks up the trace context
 * exactly as the leader's does.  No bespoke parallel-state plumbing
 * is required.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *
 *	 * The header handler is registered at the dispatcher's single
 *	   on-set entry point; we install our own XactCallback to clear
 *	   the in-memory derived state at top-level transaction end.
 *	   One 'M' before BEGIN (or before a one-shot Parse/Bind/Execute)
 *	   installs context for every statement until COMMIT/ROLLBACK or
 *	   the end of the implicit transaction.  Last-write-wins.
 *	 * An emit_log_hook (in otel_log.c) fills ErrorData.trace_id /
 *	   span_id / trace_flags when not already set, so the built-in
 *	   JSON-log, CSV-log, and log_line_prefix %T / %S escapes pick
 *	   the values up automatically.
 *	 * Malformed traceparent values are rejected by the GUC check-hook
 *	   with a clear error message (instead of being silently dropped
 *	   like in the previous direct-write design); any user-facing
 *	   error is surfaced through normal GUC error reporting.
 *	 * An empty value is the documented "clear this key" convention
 *	   from the headers mechanism, and translates to a GUC reset
 *	   (SetConfigOption with a NULL value).
 *
 * Module must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries so the header
 * handler is registered before any backend processes its first 'M'
 * message, and so the custom GUCs are defined before any worker
 * tries to restore them.  CREATE EXTENSION otel_api installs the
 * introspection SQL function but is not required for receiving
 * trace context from clients.
 *
 * Client-side propagation:
 *
 *	 The PRIMARY entry point is the TraceContext ('M') protocol message
 *	 (protocol 3.3+): the client sends traceparent and tracestate fields,
 *	 the handler attaches the context immediately and our clear_cb
 *	 auto-clears it at the next ReadyForQuery boundary.  Drivers
 *	 that implement the 'M' message (e.g. via libpq's
 *	 PQattachTraceContext, see src/test/modules/libpq_trace_context/) get
 *	 the scoping and the zero-extra-round-trip behaviour for free.
 *
 *	 ALTERNATIVELY, clients may set the GUCs directly with SQL:
 *
 *		 SET otel_api.traceparent = '00-{trace-id}-{span-id}-{flags}';
 *		 SET otel_api.tracestate  = 'vendor1=...,vendor2=...';
 *
 *	 or, scoped to one transaction:
 *
 *		 BEGIN;
 *		 SET LOCAL otel_api.traceparent = '...';
 *		 SELECT ...;
 *		 COMMIT;
 *
 *	 This works because otel_api.traceparent / otel_api.tracestate are
 *	 ordinary PGC_USERSET GUCs.  Use it when:
 *
 *	   * the driver doesn't support the 'M' message yet;
 *	   * an ORM / pooler intercepts protocol-level extensions;
 *	   * you want explicit SQL-visible audit of context changes.
 *
 *	 Costs versus the 'M'-header path:
 *
 *	   * Extra round-trip.  A SET is its own statement; each query
 *		 you want traced now costs two client/server round trips
 *		 instead of one.  Noticeable for high-rate workloads of
 *		 short queries; irrelevant when the traced query is itself
 *		 slow.  The 'M' header rides on the same Query message and
 *		 adds no round-trip.
 *	   * Cannot achieve statement scope.  GUC scoping options are:
 *		   - plain SET: session-scoped (persists across statements
 *			 AND transactions; survives auto-commit; the operator
 *			 must explicitly clear with `SET otel_api.traceparent = ''`
 *			 or `RESET otel_api.traceparent`).  Real risk of stale
 *			 context leaking from one logical operation to the
 *			 next, especially in long-lived connections.
 *		   - SET LOCAL: transaction-scoped (cleared at COMMIT or
 *			 ROLLBACK).  Better, but still NOT statement-scoped:
 *			 multiple statements in the same explicit transaction
 *			 all share the same context, even if they represent
 *			 different logical operations being traced separately.
 *		 The 'M' (TraceContext) message is naturally statement-scoped
 *		 in single-statement-per-message protocol use (each Query
 *		 message can carry its own context) and naturally
 *		 transaction-scoped under explicit BEGIN/COMMIT because
 *		 ClearTraceContext() is called at ReadyForQuery boundaries,
 *		 which clears the in-memory derived state.
 *	   * Connection-pooler interaction.  SET state on a pooled
 *		 connection in TRANSACTION or STATEMENT mode pooling can
 *		 leak the trace context to whichever client happens to
 *		 borrow the connection next, unless the pooler explicitly
 *		 discards GUC state between clients (PgBouncer in
 *		 transaction mode does NOT discard PGC_USERSET GUC state).
 *		 The 'M' header is per-message and confined to its own
 *		 transaction, so it has no equivalent leak.
 *	   * Visibility in pg_stat_statements / log_statement.  The SET
 *		 statements appear in query logs and pg_stat_statements
 *		 entries, mixing trace propagation with workload metrics.
 *		 The 'M' header is below the SQL layer and doesn't appear.
 *
 *	 Use SET / SET LOCAL when you have no other choice; prefer 'M'
 *	 when both are available.
