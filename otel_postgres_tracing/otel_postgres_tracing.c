 *
 * otel_postgres_tracing.c
 *	  Module entry point for contrib/otel_postgres_tracing.
 *
 * This module is the query-instrumentation consumer of contrib/otel's
 * OtelTracingApi.  It installs ExecutorStart / ExecutorEnd /
 * ProcessUtility_hook callbacks that build statement-level spans
 * and an emit_log_hook callback that captures ereport events as
 * span events on the active span.  All cross-module work goes
 * through the cached OtelTracingApi function pointers; no direct
 * extern symbol references into contrib/otel.
 *
 * The split between this module and contrib/otel was introduced
 * in Phase 4 of the contrib/otel restructure (see contrib-otel-
 * split.md in the parent workspace).  Before the split, the query-
 * tracing hooks lived inside contrib/otel itself and reached into
 * its internal storage directly.
 *
 * Load order: otel_postgres_tracing may appear anywhere in
 * shared_preload_libraries (or session_preload_libraries, or be
 * LOADed at session start).  The provider rendezvous is resolved
 * lazily at first hot-path use via otel_api_get() so preload order
 * is irrelevant.  If the provider is absent, tracing degrades to a
 * silent zero-cost no-op.
